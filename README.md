# Project Structure

This project follows a standard directory structure for organizing a Go gRPC microservice application:

- **api/**: Contains Protobuf service definitions. This is where you define your gRPC service and messages.

- **cmd/**: Houses your main application(s). Each subdirectory represents an individual application (e.g., server, client). The `main.go` files here initialize and run your application.

- **internal/**: Contains internal packages that are specific to your application. This prevents them from being imported by other applications.

  - **config/**: Handles configuration loading and parsing.
  - **handler/**: Implements gRPC handlers. Converts gRPC requests to service method calls.
  - **model/**: Defines data models used throughout the application.
  - **repository/**: Contains the data access layer, handling interactions with databases or external services.
  - **service/**: Houses the business logic layer, implementing the core functionalities of your service.

- **pkg/**: Contains reusable packages that can be shared across different services or projects. These packages should not have any dependency on the internal packages.

  - **middleware/**: Custom middleware for handling cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, etc.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions used across the application.

- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for deployment, continuous integration, and other tasks related to development and operations.

- **Dockerfile**: Configures the Docker image for your service.

- **go.mod** and **go.sum**: Define and manage Go modules and their dependencies.

## Usage

To use this project structure, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Modify the Protobuf service definitions in the `api/` directory according to your service requirements.
3. Implement your service logic in the `internal/` directory, separating concerns as necessary.
4. Develop your main application(s) in the `cmd/` directory, utilizing the internal packages for functionality.
5. Utilize the `pkg/` directory for reusable packages that can be shared across different services or projects.
6. Use the `scripts/` directory for deployment, continuous integration, and other development-related tasks.
7. Customize the `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image for your service.
8. Manage dependencies using `go mod` commands.
